# Thinking Haskell

- Haskell is functional

- Everything is immutable

- Functions can be passed to other functions

- No for/while loops

- Recursion used often

- No variables

- Values are all constants

- Statically typed

- Is lazy (doesn't execute more than it needs to)

- Very strict error checking

- Type inference

- Great for math
